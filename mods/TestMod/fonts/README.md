The files in the font folder are licensed under the license in the same folder.
Note that I'm not entirely sure if I understood correctly that those specific files
are licensed under this license, because the zip file from the releases page on
the github repo does not contain a license file at the time of writing this, nor
is there a note about a license in the contained readme. Based on that I assume
that these files are licensed under the same license as the project as a whole.
